# BridgingBlake3ToPy
This code is technical part of my Bachalor's thesis. It's all about Bridging Blake3 hash function to Python with full support of paralelism and execution of SIMD instructions.

TEST VECTORS:
https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3/blob/master/test_vectors/test_vectors.json

Progress:

Speed up process from 16sec to 3.3sec using paralelism (rayon lib)[x]
Speed up process from 3.3sec to ??? sec using SIMD [ ]
Bridge it to python
